# Cheffo is a homemade food ordering application, based on location and social network.

Cheffo aims to connect chefs / cooks / people who like to cook with people who are interested in home-made and quality food. Our assumption is that people have started to cook more home-cooked food and order food at home unlike eating in restaurants (mainly due to the corona virus), in addition there are kibbutzim and moshavim communities around which there is not much variety of restaurants or not at all.

There are two interfaces: 
1) Interface for a customer who wants to order food - Cheffo app 
2) Interface for chefs - Cheffo web

The customer interface is basically an application where you can search for the desired food according to distance, rating, etc. You can see previous orders, reviews and profile. In addition, we created a social network that any user can follow another user and thus see the food orders he posted and thus will rely on his order for a personal recommendation of a friend.

The chefs interface is an online interface and there are 4 pages: reviews, new orders, dishes and profile so the chef can see the new orders and edit his dishes.
